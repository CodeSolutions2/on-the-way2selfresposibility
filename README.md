## 5th topic

Taking responsibility for one's self is to not blaim other people or things for success or non-success.

Taking responsibility for one's self is to choose and inform other's about how you would like to be treated. Thus, understanding one's self, one's limits, and being organized such that one is able to tell other people what one needs and/or does not need for their life to be happy, healthy, and successful.

Taking responsibility for one's self is to know one's limits for risky behavior and responsibility. Taking on too much responsibility by participating in situations where you are held responsible, can give you an unreliable repuation for not completing promises and even prevent you from acheiving your desired short-term and long-term agenda due to inability to physically complete tasked work/situational promises. In my opinion, the practice of gossiping, announcing information about other people, and talking about other people in front of an audience forces the people present to be responsible/connected to the information that was discussed. Similar, to work meetings, everyone included in the room is partially responisble for the information discussed. Thus, in order to be effective, it is good practice to try to avoid being included with situations and information that is not aligned with your short-term and long-term goals, such that you are not obligated to take responsibility for things that you are not interested with and/or have nothing to do with your life.

If you can not make, execute, and receive rewards from decisions and/or actions that you have made and/or done, to have long-term success, you are likely included in situations that do not foster/agree with your life well-being and thinking. In such a situation, it is necessary to take "responsibility for your life" by : [0] evaluating what you would like to happen to you, [1] evaluating how you feel and how you would like to feel about the situation, [2] identify situational aspects that prevent you from obtaining "what you would like to happen" and "how you would like to feel", [3] identify a few changes/improvements to the situational aspects that would allow you to improve your life, [4] tell others in real-life how you would like to be treated with respect to the situational aspects and give your suggestions for improvements and how it would impact/improve your life. You will need to repeat your message of how you would like to be treated, and give constructive feedback to others so that they understand and respect your wishes (ie: human rights) about how you would like to be treated. Do not be discouraged if your life does not immediately improve, be persistent in a calm and logical manner and document small events/improvements as milestones for success and/or improvements to goal planning about the situation.

"Event-based responsive" selection versus "Long-term thoughtful" selection
It is common behavior for people to say "no, I do not want that/it/him/her/them" or "I do not need it/that", for situations that are not desireable. But, these phrases only address and give guidance, for one event at one instance. These phrases are less effective phrases to guide one's life with because they give no short-term or long-term guidance for how one would want to be treated in life with respect to varied situations. "Event-based responsive" selection is responding to the situation with the opinion of the group/environment, with an emotional "yes" or "no" without performing constructive feedback steps 3 and 4 to guide the situation to better align with your short-term/long-term goals (ie: how you would like to be treated with respect to the current situation and similar future situations).

Imagine if you went to an LLM promt and typed "I do not want that", the LLM would not have any information to understand what you want. Instructing/guiding your life is the same as writing a good descriptive LLM prompt or a good concise Internet search keyword phrase into the browser. Short-term goals, long-term goals, acceptable daily-life interactions and behavior are ways to make instructions and guidelines for one's life. Making instruction and guidelines for one's life need to be specific and concise such that you and other's can organize actions and ideas in order to accomplish them. "Long-term thoughtful" selection of things, like concepts/ideas, life-styles, and behaviors, that you want in life means to make and enforce guidelines in response to life-feedback that are aligned with your life-goals. For example, if you apply for a job and receive a lot of negative environmental feedback about your profile/presence, it is thoughtful in a long-term manner be persistant and take responsibility for your life, instead of blaiming, complaining, or being demanding. Again, taking "responsibility for your life" means to have short-term and long-term goals, evaluate the situation, identify improvements to the situation that would allow your goals to be full-filled, execute the improvements and receive feedback. Continue taking "responsibility for your life" until you either get-better/evolve and fit-into the situation, aligned with your goals, and/or you find an environment/group that align with your goals. Taking "responsibility for your life" for the example, is to either try to change your profile to match the environmental feedback or try to find jobs that better match your profile/presence in the environment with less effort and profile change. It is not a certainty that you find a job, however with persistance and continued effort improves the chances of success, because everything that you do to accomplish your goals will allow more improved knowledge and information about the goal/s with respect to what you did, to come to you. In addition, having a "Long-term thoughtful" selection approach to life creates a more peaceful, intelligent, and meaningful life than a "Event-based responsive" emotional approach.
